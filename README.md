Hi there ,
in this Repo I am trying to cover the main Concepts in Asp.net

in Solution OOP :
we may find some useful concepts about passing by value and passing by reference 
as we have data types (by value ,by ref ) also we have obj and var.
so what changes and what remains the same.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
in Solution Validators :
we may find examples on all validations Topics like 
*required field 
*comapre 
*regular
*range 
*custom
*validation summary
*validation groups
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
in Authentication and Authorization:
 -Anonymouse: anyone can view all pages.
 -Windows : a user may have the same access privilages as his windows /Domain Porvided - used in      interanet websites(within orgnization).
 -Form : either static usernames in web config ,
          or retrieve them for DB.
*main point :
1-a logged user may only view welcome.aspx page.
2-any user may view register.aspx
3-retrieve username from DB.
