In This Project we Learn about validation in asp.net,
we have 6 main points to cover.
  1. RequiredFieldValidator
  2. RangeValidator 
  3. RegularExpressionValidator
  4. CompareValidator
  5. CustomValidator    
  6. ValidationSummary 
  
in this project I have implemented :
on name control : requiredfiledvaldator
on pw and confirm pw : comparevalidator
on mail : regualr expression validator
on even : custom validator to check if number is even
one age : range validator .

aslo 
a save button : to save data and disply it below in a label (later to be replaced by a DB connection).
a reset button : to reset all controls using jquery.


you may also find :
a form called viewstate : to show that viewstate is used to retain value over the same form as the web is statless .
a form called session : to  pass a value form one form to the other 
a simple example about IsPostBack : which is false when the first time the page to be rendered ,the true if the page has been submitted .
